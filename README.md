Hypothesis: By analyzing the music datasets produced by Spotify and Billboard, we will understand:

-Based on aspects of music, specifically Valence (Degree of happinness), Energy and Danceability, understand how have those evolved through time.
----Do global events have influence on them?
----How those aspects manifest in different countries?

-How do said aspects relate to music produced in the countries on scope (Mexico, Argentina, Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan and UK)
----How do those aspects relate to music consumed in the countries?
----Which are the aspects in which we should focus to forge succesfull carreers?

-How do these aspects relate to location of the countries?
----Is it true that, closer to the Equator music tends to be more Happy (Valence)? 
----How do the other aspects relate in that geographic sense?

Why we want to know that?

We are a data-driven agency focused on developing musical talents with high Return of Investment, so we want to understand the features of local music trends
in order to leverage them for our business.
